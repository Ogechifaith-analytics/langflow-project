## Overview
This is a chatbot workflow created using langflow hosted on the Datastax website. It demonstrates my knowledge of working with langflow.

## How it works
i used Ollama model, generated a base URL. 
Created a prompt, with variables the in a curled bracket, connect it to the Language model( ollama model)nto generate responses.
Drag and drop the input,prompt ,model and output component on the work canvas,while connecting nodes to each component, to show the data flow.
